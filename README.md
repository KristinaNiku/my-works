This is a site with links to my work that I do while learning to program.
On this page you can read brief information about me and see my works.
The finished page was taken as a basis, where I added my works.
The site will be updated as I learn.
You can open the page and scroll down. My projects will alternate and you can choose the one you want to look at and click on it.
